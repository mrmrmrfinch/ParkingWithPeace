# ðŸš— Parking With Peace

**Project in progress. Help Appreciated!**

Have you ever gotten a parking ticket when parking on campus? On top of already expensive tuition, most universities enforce strict regulations around parking. Each ticket can cost anywhere between $15 to $60, and if you don't pay it on time, the price can double, triple; one day you may even find your car being wheellocked.

You may not believe this, but parking tickets are a huge source of revenue for universities. As an example, Montclair State University made over $1 million just in parking tickets from the last three years (See [News](https://themontclarion.org/news/montclair-state-university-made-over-1-million-in-parking-tickets-in-the-last-three-years/)). That's a lot of money! As a result, many students have to pay hundreds, even thousands of dollars in parking tickets each year. 

Parking with Peace attempts to solve this problem.

## How it works
We start by building an interactive website for everyone to log where and when they received a parking ticket. Anyone can log a ticket, and at the same time, see the tickets logged by others. We aim to provide a "trend map" that allows you to visualize where and when tickets have been given out in the past days.

It doesn't stop here. We believe in the power of crowd-sourcing, not just on the data collection end, but also the analyzation end. To this front, the logged data will be released regularly in CSV format as part of a Kaggle Challenge. The key question we want to answer is: **What's the probability heatmap for getting a ticket, at a certain time range in a given day?**. We hope that by answering this question, we can help students avoid getting tickets, and save them money.
